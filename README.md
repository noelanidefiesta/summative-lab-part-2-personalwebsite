Summative Lab Part 2: Personal Website Creation

Noelani Defiesta's Personal Website
This website is a personal project created to showcase my journey as a software engineering student at Flatiron School. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site highlights a couple of early projects Iâ€™ve worked on in the first month of my studies.

Projects Featured:
JavaScript Calculator
A simple, functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and keeps track of the calculation history. This project helped me practice core programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, and arrays in JavaScript.

Cat Breed Layout Practice
A basic webpage layout featuring different cat breeds, built with HTML and CSS. This project gave me hands-on experience in structuring a page, organizing content, and applying CSS to create an organized and visually appealing layout.

Technologies Used:
HTML

CSS

JavaScript

GitHub Repositories:

This website also features a personalized design with custom CSS to reflect my own style. Feel free to explore and check out the code!
