    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Noelani, Lani for short! I'm based in Brooklyn, NY and currently studying software engineering at Flatiron School. In my first month, I’ve been diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—getting a feel for how the web works and building small projects that bring those languages to life. When I’m not coding, I’m usually spending time with my fiancé and our senior chihuahua (who definitely runs the house). I also love to read, catch waves whenever I get the chance to surf, and play a handful of instruments to keep my creative side active.

        <h3>JavaScript Calculator</h3>
        <p>This project is a simple JavaScript calculator I built to practice core programming concepts like functions, conditionals, and arrays. It performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—and keeps a running history of each calculation. It was one of the first major labs I completed at Flatiron School and helped me get more comfortable writing and organizing code in JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Cat Breed Layout Practice!</h3>
        <p>This project was a simple website layout featuring different cat breeds, built using basic HTML and CSS. It helped me learn how to structure a page properly, organize content, and apply styling to create a clean, readable layout. It was one of my first steps in understanding how HTML and CSS work together to build the front end of a website.</p>
